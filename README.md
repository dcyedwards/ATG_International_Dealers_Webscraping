# ATG_International_Dealers_Webscraping
Eight Python scripts to navigate to eight websites and source international auction dealers for the Marketing team of the Auction Technology Group. This project was an effort of the Marketing Team to grow their customer base from just British based dealers to global ones too.  Consequently, the script queries websites and retrieves the details (company names, websites, email addresses, physical addresses, etc) of over 3,800 international dealers. To accomplish this task manually and without errors would take an estimated 3 months. However the scripts accomplish the task in about 8 hours which frees up time for other equally pressing things.
